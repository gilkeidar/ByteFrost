# Programs

Here is a list of included programs.

> Note: ByteFrost assembly programs have the file extension `.asm` and can be compiled to `.mlg` (this rewrites the assembly program into machine language in ASCII, useful for uploading a program to the program EEPROM using Arduino code) and `.bin` (which compiles the assembly directly to binary)

## Assembly Programs

* `BIST.asm` - Built-In Self Test (tests hardware operations such as the ALU, RAM, register file, and display) - written by Ron Keidar
* `memdump.asm` - (fill program information here) - written by Ron Keidar
