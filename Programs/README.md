Here is a list of included programs.

> Note: ByteFrost assembly programs have the file extension `.asm` and can be compiled to `.a` (this rewrites the assembly program into microcode in ASCII, useful for uploading a program to the program EEPROM using Arduino code) and `.bin` (which compiles the assembly directly to binary)
