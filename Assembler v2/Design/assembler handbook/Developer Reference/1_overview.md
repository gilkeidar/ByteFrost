#   Developer Reference Overview

This first volume of the *ByteFrost Assembler Handbook* documents the ByteFrost
Assembler software architecture, including the software pipeline, each of its
stages, and important definitions / algorithm descriptions. It is written for
the intended use of a maintainer or expander of the ByteFrost Assembler
capabilities, and so contains sections for how to expand the ByteFrost Assembler
in each pipeline stage.
